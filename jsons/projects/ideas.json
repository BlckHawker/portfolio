Although I never had the time to get into the hobby myself, I enjoy watching competitive cubing. I find the idea of memorizing patterns in order to optimize the solving process fascinating. A few years later, I took a class that focused on the use AI in games. We learned about neural networking and Q learning (a machine learning algorithm where the machine iteratively learns how to solve something and improves over time). I figured a rubik's cube would be a great puzzle to understand the algorithm more."

One of the projects I was assigned was to create a project use boids (artificial intelligence to simulate free will of objects, mainly through movement). The theme of my project, at the time, was Human vs Zombies (a large game of tag where the zombies are it). The humans' only job was to run away, while the zombies' job was to chase the humans. There was nothing for the \"player\" to do besides watch the simulation run.\nI have the idea of changing the theme to Rock Paper Scissors where each boids would run away and chase each target. When a collision happens, a boid will change to another team. For example, rocks colliding to paper will turn into paper. I am planning to add sliders that will change the stats of each boids including but not limited to: movement speed, the radius of their vision, how much they prefer chasing something rather than running away, etc. The player will also have the option to place obstacles anywhere on the map that all boids will need to avoid in order to not get deleted."

These categories can then either have items or more subcategories, making a tree structure with a limited depth. The user will have the option of depositing or withdrawing money to/from a certain item/category along with notes. I'm planning on having depositing be customizable where the user has the option of automatically giving a certain category a percentage of the deposit. Or have a priority system where all the money goes into a certain category until the \"goal amount\" is reached. Then all deposited money will go into the next category. I also want each category to have its own stats section where users can see what they're spending most of their money on."

Throughout that time, I have thought of creating a \"solver\" that would tell the user the best optimization of floors to buy and where to hire people. Although I still like this idea and plan to implement it, it's too opened minded as there are a lot of factors in play. It would be better to create a simulation of the game where the user can easily put their data in first, and then start working on an optimization.\nI could make the simulation a Windows Form GUI the same way I did for my <a href=\"{root}/projects/ktane.html#Solver\" target=\"_blank\">KTANE Solver</a> project, but that seems too easy (and not that pretty).

This risk can be reduced by having extra security measures such as 2 factor authentication, but many people fail to do this. Regardless of if extra security measures a present or not, it's important to have a good password. There are several password generators that gives passwords that look like they gave a 3 year old the keyboard. This is because the password is so random that it's difficult for hackers to guess. However, it can also be difficult for the user the remember. This is what password managers such as the ones that are native to many web browsers are for. They hold onto the passwords so you don't have to remember them, and you need to remember just one password. Though, this means that all of your information are in a vault in which a hacker needs guess one password in order to get all of them.\nThe \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NjQ9b3pgIg\" target=\"_blank\">Computerphile</a>\" suggests creating a password that is a string of 3-5 random words with some of the letters being replaced with special characters. And not special characters where you replace a 'e' with a '3' as that's too predictable. A better example would be changing a random consonant to a '#'; this decreases the chances of hacker taking your information. I use one of these password managers, and though they are very useful for holding passwords, it's rather difficult to quickly get a password for a new account Although there are some applications that generate passwords, they only generate the ones thats should be used as the \"non-main\" password. Having an option of if the generated password should be a \"main\" password can encourage people to be more careful with their information."

There will be a notes section that has a title, date, and session # properties so people can easily find them.\nI also want to add a dice roller section so people can do other things besides doing math the entire session. This includes a button for each type of saving throw, along with each skill check with the option of adding if it's with advantage/disadvantage. I also want to add attack rolls as well. Since the character (and their loot) is already loaded, the bonuses from the skills and modifies should already be in the application's memory.

This lack of public source code can limit community engagement. If there is a bug and the author is not active, the mod is marked as incompatible since others are unable to fix the issue. Additionally, mods without accessible source code are less likely to gain new features like Twitch Plays, Rule Seed Support, and Mod Settings if they weren't there in the original build.\nDecompilation solves this problem with the use of tools that easily allows extraction of important files from the build in order to recreate the mod to almost a one to one replica. Currently, there are only a handful of people who know how to decompile a mod. I have reached out to one of these people to teach me. My plan is to document the process via the KTANE FAQ bot so others can learn as well. My hope that if enough people are aware how it's done, the more source code will be found.\nThat being said, some source code will need to stay hidden as some mods do take the game's code, and the community does not want to cause any legal trouble. Not to mention that it take a lot of effort to put a mod back together, and not all mods need to have their source code public if there's nothing wrong with the mod. I've decided to come to a compromise of only decompiling mods if it's necessary. Necessary is subjective, but it would include mods that have some sort of bug, and the source is unavailable. Either me or another developer would be the maintainer of that mod in case future bugs are found. There are also mods that could use some <a href=\"{root}/projects/ktane.html#Souvenir\"  target=\"_blank\">Souvenir</a> or Twitch Plays support. These modules don't need the entire module decomplied, but rather just the scripts. I will keep a separate repo for those scripts so others can check if their is a Souvenir or Twitch Plays bug."
