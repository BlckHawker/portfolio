                "When I first was introduced to the modding community of KTANE, I wanted to create solvers of modules other people created given some information from the bomb. The program requires the user to have the bomb running with the program right next to it. The program then asks for edgework from the bomb, and which module the user wants to be solved. Depending on the module, the user will need to type in information from that module that for program asks for. This is when I was first learning how to program. I used the manual as instructions of how the program should work, and used Windows Forms to create GUIs for the user to input the needed information to get the correct answer."

                "After a few years of creating solvers of KTANE mods, I decided to create some mods of my own. Not only did I have to write the logic of solving the mod, I also had to write the instructions, model it, and write the logic for interactions. I like creating mods more than creating solvers since it gives me more freedom in terms of creativity. The modding community also has a sub group on Twitch, mostly known as “Twitch Plays”, where players can go to a Twitch channel and play the game through chat commands. There is a special command called “force solve” where the module solves itself. Although it’s unnecessary, most modders implement this by having the module figuring out the calculations itself and pressing its own buttons to solve it. I add Twitch Plays support to all my mods because I want to make my modules accessible to everyone, even those who don't own the game and can only play through Twitch. It's also a decent challenge development wise."

While I enjoy teaching people, it can be tedious to type out the same detailed messages multiple times. Although the answers to these questions have been documented, they are scattered throughout the server with various levels of depth.\nI created a FAQ feature in the already existing KTANE bot created by Qksiri. The FAQ command works by giving the category the question falls under. A dropdown will then appear with each selection being questions that fall under the selected category. When a user selects the question, the bot will send the answer to the question. This way, developers can quickly find the answers they need without having to blindly search through the server."
